### PRODUCTION SYSTEM FOR BEHAVIORS ###

## WALL AVOIDANCE
variables: 8 wall distances, speed

- wall left/right = near
  tracking = near
  speed = low
=> thrust

- wall left/right = near
  tracking = medium/far
  speed = low
OR
  wall left/right = medium/far
  tracking = medium/far
  speed = high
=> turn right/left

- wall front/back = near
  tracking = near
  speed = low
=> thrust

- wall front/back = near
  wall left = near
  speed = low
OR
  wall front/back = medium/far
  wall left = medium/far
  speed = high
=> turn right

- wall front/back = near
  wall right = near
  speed = low
OR
  wall front/back = medium/far
  wall right = medium/far
  speed = high
=> turn left



## BULLET DODGING
variables: shot angle, tracking
(shot distance, short alert, enemyHeading)

( Calculate difference between shot angle and agent's tracking:
  -angle difference < |shot angle - tracking| < angle difference
  180 - angle difference < |shot angle - tracking| < 180 + angle difference)

- shot angle = tracking
=> turn and thrust

- shot angle != tracking
=> thrust

- if none
=> spin


## SHOOTING
variables: aimdir
- aimdir < 180
=> turn right

- aimdir > 180
=> turn left

- if none
=> shoot

## Questions
+ Where to get idx?
+ aimdir returns what?

## Task
- [] Write fuzzy system for wall avoidance behavior
